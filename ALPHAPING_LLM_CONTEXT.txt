1. WHAT ALPHAPING IS

ONE-SENTENCE DEFINITION
AlphaPing is an operator-grade risk curator that designs and operates mandate-driven, on-chain credit vaults with explicit, mechanically enforced risk boundaries.

WHAT PROBLEM ALPHAPING SOLVES
On-chain credit markets offer transparency and efficiency, but they expose allocators to:
- Poorly defined risk
- Discretionary management decisions
- Opaque parameter changes
- Liquidity surprises during stress
- Misaligned incentives between managers and capital
AlphaPing exists to remove these failure modes.
The core problem AlphaPing addresses is not yield generation, but risk definition, enforcement, and continuity in on-chain credit.

CORE IDEA
AlphaPing separates risk curation from:
- Capital allocation decisions by end users
- Protocol-level governance
- Discretionary portfolio management
Each AlphaPing vault is built around:
- A clearly defined mandate
- Explicit risk boundaries
- Mechanical enforcement on-chain
- Continuous monitoring
- Predefined behavior under stress
Nothing operates “by feel.”

WHO ALPHAPING IS FOR
AlphaPing is designed for participants who require:
- Predictable behavior under stress
- Transparent and verifiable risk constraints
- Continuous liquidity subject to stated limits
- Clear accountability
Typical users include:
- Institutional allocators
- Family offices
- DAOs and protocol treasuries
- Distribution partners
- Structured product issuers

WHAT ALPHAPING IS NOT
AlphaPing is not:
- A hedge fund
- An active or discretionary asset manager
- A yield-maximization strategy
- A trading desk
- A protocol that takes custody of funds
AlphaPing does not:
- Chase opportunistic yield
- Override risk boundaries for performance
- Make discretionary market calls

OPERATOR MODEL (HIGH LEVEL)
AlphaPing operates vaults as an operator, not as a trader.
This means:
- Mandates are defined upfront
- Risk boundaries are enforced mechanically
- Changes are deliberate and explicit
- Behavior is stable across market regimes
Performance is a result of structure, not the objective.

END OF SECTION 1

2. HOW ALPHAPING WORKS (MECHANICS)

OPERATOR-GRADE DESIGN
AlphaPing operates as an on-chain credit operator, not a discretionary manager.
Vault behavior is determined by:
- A predefined mandate
- Explicit risk parameters
- Mechanical execution on-chain
Once a vault is live, it operates within these constraints at all times.

NON-CUSTODIAL, ON-CHAIN SETUP
AlphaPing vaults are:
- Fully on-chain
- Non-custodial
- Transparent by default
Users retain control of their assets through smart contracts.
AlphaPing does not custody funds and does not have discretionary withdrawal authority.
All positions, parameters, and risk exposures are verifiable on-chain.

RELATIONSHIP TO MORPHO (V2 VAULTS)
AlphaPing vaults are built on Morpho’s credit infrastructure.
Morpho provides:
- Peer-to-peer matching efficiency
- Isolated market structures
- On-chain enforcement of risk parameters
AlphaPing sits above the protocol layer and is responsible for:
- Market selection
- Collateral scope
- Parameter configuration
- Ongoing risk oversight within mandate
AlphaPing does not modify Morpho’s core mechanics.

MANDATE-DRIVEN CONFIGURATION
Each AlphaPing vault is defined by a mandate that specifies:
- Eligible markets
- Accepted collateral types
- Maximum loan-to-value ratios
- Oracle dependencies
- Liquidity constraints
These parameters are:
- Explicit
- Public
- Enforced mechanically
If an action would violate the mandate, it cannot be executed.

CONTINUOUS SETTLEMENT & LIQUIDITY
AlphaPing vaults support continuous settlement.
Withdrawals are processed:
- On-chain
- In real time
- Subject to available on-chain liquidity
Liquidity availability is not assumed.
It is monitored, disclosed, and constrained by the mandate.

NO DISCRETIONARY INTERVENTION
AlphaPing does not:
- Rebalance positions opportunistically
- Override risk limits
- Delay withdrawals to protect performance
Intervention is limited to:
- Actions explicitly permitted by the mandate
- Risk containment measures defined in advance

MONITORING & OVERSIGHT
AlphaPing continuously monitors:
- Market health
- Collateral performance
- Utilization levels
- Oracle behavior
- Liquidity conditions
Monitoring informs:
- Transparency
- Disclosure
- Predefined risk responses
It does not introduce discretion.

FAILURE MODE AWARENESS
AlphaPing’s operating model is designed around known failure modes in on-chain credit:
- Liquidity cliffs
- Oracle degradation
- Correlated collateral stress
- Parameter drift
Vaults are constructed to limit exposure, not eliminate risk.

END OF SECTION 2

3. RISK CURATION & RISK MANAGEMENT

WHAT “RISK CURATION” MEANS AT ALPHAPING
At AlphaPing, risk curation is the process of defining, constraining, and enforcing risk before capital is deployed.
It is not:
- Forecasting markets
- Chasing yield
- Reacting opportunistically
Risk is treated as a design input, not a variable to optimize after deployment.

MANDATE FIRST, CAPITAL SECOND
Every AlphaPing vault begins with a mandate.
The mandate defines:
- What risks are acceptable
- What risks are excluded
- How the vault behaves under normal and stressed conditions
Capital is only deployed after these boundaries are fixed.
If a risk cannot be clearly bounded, it is not included.

EXPLICIT RISK BOUNDARIES
Risk boundaries are explicit and verifiable.
They typically include:
- Maximum loan-to-value ratios
- Eligible collateral definitions
- Market and maturity constraints
- Oracle dependencies
- Liquidity and utilization limits
These boundaries are:
- Public
- Enforced on-chain
- Not adjustable without explicit action
There are no implicit safeguards.

MECHANICAL ENFORCEMENT
Once set, risk boundaries are enforced mechanically by smart contracts.
This means:
- No manual overrides
- No discretionary exceptions
- No silent parameter drift
If a transaction would violate the mandate, it cannot execute.

RISK IS NOT DYNAMICALLY “OPTIMIZED”
AlphaPing does not dynamically adjust risk parameters to:
- Improve yield
- Respond to market sentiment
- Offset losses
Risk parameters may only change through:
- Explicit, deliberate updates
- Clearly communicated rationale
- Defined governance or operator processes
Stability is preferred over responsiveness.

LIQUIDITY AS A FIRST-CLASS RISK
Liquidity is treated as a core risk dimension.
AlphaPing explicitly models:
- T+0 withdrawal availability
- Utilization thresholds
- Liquidity concentration
Liquidity constraints are disclosed and enforced.
They are not assumed.

STRESS SCENARIO DESIGN
AlphaPing vaults are designed with stress in mind, not as an afterthought.
Design considers:
- Sharp price declines
- Correlated collateral stress
- Oracle latency or degradation
- Liquidity drawdowns
The goal is not to avoid losses at all costs, but to:
- Contain them
- Make outcomes predictable
- Avoid uncontrolled failure modes

LOSS IS A DEFINED OUTCOME, NOT A SURPRISE
AlphaPing assumes losses are possible.
Risk curation focuses on:
- Where losses can occur
- How large they can be
- How they are realized
- Who bears them
There is no loss socialization beyond what is explicitly defined.

CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT WITHOUT DISCRETION
AlphaPing continuously monitors risk exposure.
Monitoring supports:
- Transparency
- Disclosure
- Early warning signals
It does not introduce discretionary portfolio management.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Most on-chain credit failures occur due to:
- Implicit assumptions
- Unbounded risk
- Discretion under stress
- Liquidity mismatches
AlphaPing’s risk curation model exists to remove these failure modes.

END OF SECTION 3

4. VAULT STRUCTURE & STRATEGIES

VAULT AS A RISK CONTAINER
Each AlphaPing vault is a self-contained risk container.
A vault represents:
- One mandate
- One risk profile
- One set of enforceable boundaries
There is no cross-subsidization between vaults.
Risk is not pooled implicitly across strategies.

CORE VAULTS
Core Vaults are designed for capital preservation first.
Their defining characteristics:
- Senior-secured exposure
- Conservative loan-to-value ratios
- High liquidity targets
- Narrow collateral scope
- Stable benchmark-relative return intent
Core Vaults are structured to:
- Remain operational through volatility
- Prioritize withdrawal continuity
- Accept lower returns in exchange for predictability
They are not designed to maximize yield.

ENHANCED VAULTS
Enhanced Vaults introduce additional, explicitly bounded risk.
Enhancements may include:
- Broader collateral sets
- Higher utilization ranges
- Longer effective exposure duration
- More complex market structures
Enhanced Vaults still operate within strict mandates.
They do not relax mechanical enforcement.
Risk is increased only where it can be clearly defined and monitored.

STRATEGY DEFINITION
A strategy at AlphaPing is not a trading plan.
It is the combination of constraints:
- Which markets are accessible
- What collateral is accepted
- How leverage is bounded
- How liquidity is managed
Yield emerges from this structure.
It is not targeted independently.

BENCHMARKING PHILOSOPHY
Benchmarks are used for:
- Context
- Comparison
- Communication
They are not objectives.
AlphaPing does not manage to a benchmark.
It manages to a mandate.
Performance is evaluated relative to:
- Risk taken
- Liquidity delivered
- Mandate adherence

LIQUIDITY TARGETS
Each vault defines:
- Expected T+0 liquidity availability
- Acceptable utilization ranges
- Conditions under which liquidity may tighten
Liquidity is a constraint, not an afterthought.
Disclosures reflect actual conditions, not assumptions.

WHAT DRIVES RETURNS
Returns in AlphaPing vaults are driven by:
- Credit demand in selected markets
- Collateral quality
- Utilization within defined limits
- Market structure, not leverage
Returns are not driven by:
- Directional trading
- Volatility harvesting
- Parameter chasing

VAULT BEHAVIOR UNDER STRESS
Under stress, vaults are expected to:
- Continue operating within mandate
- Honor withdrawals subject to available liquidity
- Realize losses where defined
- Avoid uncontrolled escalation
Predictable behavior is prioritized over short-term performance.

END OF SECTION 4

5. FEES & ECONOMICS

FEE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
AlphaPing’s fee structure is designed to be:
- Explicit
- Transparent
- Aligned with mandate adherence
- Free of hidden incentives
Fees are not used to encourage risk-taking or parameter expansion.

ALPHAPING FEES
Depending on the vault and structure, AlphaPing may charge:
- A management fee
- A performance fee
Key principles:
- Fees are defined upfront
- Fee mechanics are disclosed
- Fees accrue mechanically
- There are no discretionary adjustments
If a vault has zero management fee, this is intentional and explicit.

PERFORMANCE FEES
Where performance fees apply:
- They are calculated based on realized performance
- They respect defined benchmarks or hurdle logic, where applicable
- They do not override risk constraints
Performance fees do not justify:
- Increased leverage
- Broader collateral scope
- Relaxed liquidity targets

NO HIDDEN FEES
AlphaPing does not:
- Charge routing fees
- Take undisclosed protocol incentives
- Layer implicit spreads
- Monetize order flow
All economic relationships are disclosed.

ECONOMIC ALIGNMENT
AlphaPing’s incentives are aligned with:
- Long-term vault operability
- Risk containment
- Capital continuity
Revenue is a function of:
- Vault durability
- Partner trust
- Mandate discipline
Not short-term yield.

PARTNER FEE WRAPPERS (OVERVIEW)
AlphaPing supports partner structures where:
- AlphaPing operates the underlying vault
- Partners may add a fee layer on top
- End users see a single wrapped product
Key characteristics:
- AlphaPing fees remain unchanged
- Partner fees are additive and transparent
- Risk boundaries are not altered
Details of partner structures are covered in the partnering section.

HOW FEES ARE REFLECTED
Fees are reflected through:
- Vault share price mechanics
- Explicit accounting
- On-chain transparency
There is no manual fee extraction.

WHAT FEES DO NOT BUY
Paying fees to AlphaPing does not provide:
- Discretionary intervention
- Preferential withdrawals
- Risk overrides
- Performance guarantees
Fees compensate for:
- Risk curation
- Vault operation
- Monitoring and disclosure

END OF SECTION 5

6. PARTNERING WITH ALPHAPING

PARTNERING PHILOSOPHY
AlphaPing partners with distributors, allocators, and institutions that value:
- Explicit risk definition
- Mandate discipline
- Long-term operability
- Transparent economics
Partnerships are structured to preserve AlphaPing’s core principles:
- Risk boundaries are never diluted
- Mandates remain explicit
- Fee structures are transparent
- Incentives are aligned with durability, not volume alone

TWO DISTINCT PARTNER MODELS
AlphaPing supports two primary partnership structures.

MODEL 1 — INDEPENDENT WRAPPER / DISTRIBUTION MODEL
Structure
- The partner creates a wrapper product
- The wrapper allocates capital into an underlying AlphaPing vault
- AlphaPing operates the vault independently
Fees
- Partners independently define their own management fee and their own performance fee (if any)
- AlphaPing’s fees remain unchanged and separate
- Fees are additive and transparent to end users
Key Characteristics
- AlphaPing has no influence over the partner’s wrapper fees
- Wrapper fees do not affect vault behavior or risk parameters
- The AlphaPing mandate and risk boundaries remain intact
- End users receive a single wrapped exposure
Why partners choose this model
- Full control over commercial terms
- Ability to integrate AlphaPing vaults into broader offerings
- Clear separation between risk operation and distribution economics

MODEL 2 — JOINT VAULT UNDER THE ALPHAPING UMBRELLA
Structure
- A dedicated vault is operated under the AlphaPing umbrella
- AlphaPing and the partner jointly define the mandate
- Both parties actively support the vault’s growth and distribution
Fees
- Partner charges a management fee only
- AlphaPing charges the performance fee
- No partner performance fee is applied
Liquidity Dynamics
- The partner brings liquidity into the vault
- AlphaPing may also allocate its own network liquidity into the same vault
- The partner earns its management fee on capital they bring and capital allocated by AlphaPing into the vault
Key Characteristics
- Strong alignment of incentives
- Shared interest in mandate quality and durability
- Unified product under AlphaPing’s operational standards
- No fragmentation of risk ownership
Why partners choose this model
- Participation in a scaled AlphaPing vault
- Management fee income on a larger capital base
- Long-term collaboration on mandate design
- Increased credibility through AlphaPing’s risk framework

MANDATE CO-DESIGN
Mandates are designed collaboratively, boundaries are negotiated explicitly, constraints are fixed before launch.
AlphaPing retains responsibility for risk curation, mechanical enforcement, and ongoing oversight within the mandate.
Partners do not gain discretionary control over risk parameters.

DISTRIBUTION EFFECTS
Because mandates are explicit and public:
- Other distributors may independently allocate
- Allocators can compare mandates transparently
- Successful mandates can attract third-party capital organically

WHAT PARTNERS DO NOT RECEIVE
Partnering with AlphaPing does not grant:
- Discretionary control over the vault
- Ability to override risk constraints
- Preferential treatment under stress
- Implicit guarantees
All partners operate under the same structural rules.

END OF SECTION 6

7. LISTING COLLATERAL / BORROWING FROM ALPHAPING

WHO THIS IS FOR
This section applies to protocols, asset issuers, DAOs/treasuries, structured product issuers, and entities seeking to borrow against on-chain collateral.
AlphaPing is not a general-purpose lending desk. Collateral onboarding is selective and mandate-driven.

CORE PRINCIPLE
AlphaPing does not “list assets.” It curates collateral risk within explicit credit mandates.
Borrowing access exists only where:
- Risk can be clearly defined
- Liquidation paths are credible
- Failure modes are bounded
- Behavior under stress is predictable

COLLATERAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Collateral is assessed across multiple dimensions, including:
- Asset structure
- Liquidity
- Price discovery
- Liquidation feasibility

MANDATE-LEVEL DECISION, NOT GLOBAL APPROVAL
Collateral approval is vault-specific and mandate-specific.
Approval in one vault does not imply general AlphaPing endorsement.

BORROWING PARAMETERS
Borrowing is constrained by explicit maximum loan-to-value ratios, utilization limits, oracle dependencies, and liquidation thresholds.
These parameters are defined upfront, enforced mechanically, and publicly verifiable.

PROCESS FOR COLLATERAL CONSIDERATION
Entities provide asset documentation, liquidity analysis, oracle references, and stress behavior assumptions.
AlphaPing evaluates whether the risk can be bounded and whether it fits an existing mandate or requires a new one.

WHAT ALPHAPING DOES NOT DO
AlphaPing does not customize risk per borrower, grant exceptions, accept illiquid collateral without credible exits, or support assets purely for yield enhancement.

OUTCOMES UNDER STRESS
If collateral deteriorates:
- Liquidation follows predefined mechanics
- Losses are realized according to mandate design
- There is no discretionary forbearance

WHY THIS APPROACH EXISTS
Most on-chain credit failures stem from overestimating collateral liquidity, implicit guarantees, and delayed liquidation decisions.

END OF SECTION 7

8. LOSS TREATMENT & LIQUIDATION

LOSS IS AN EXPECTED OUTCOME
Loss is a defined outcome and modeled scenario. It is not necessarily an operational failure if it occurs within defined boundaries.

NO LOSS SOCIALIZATION
Losses are borne by the vault exposed to the risk.
There is no cross-vault backstopping and no implicit guarantees.

ACCOUNTING LOSS TREATMENT
Losses are reflected through vault share price adjustments, on-chain accounting, and transparent reporting.
No off-chain smoothing or discretionary accounting.

LIQUIDATION MECHANICS
Liquidation behavior is defined upfront, enforced by smart contracts, and triggered by objective conditions.

TIMING AND EXECUTION
Liquidations may occur under adverse conditions. AlphaPing prioritizes mechanical execution, predictable outcomes, and mandate adherence.

ROLE OF DISCRETION
No discretionary intervention to pause liquidations, renegotiate borrower terms, or protect counterparties.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A LOSS
Vault continues operating if mandate conditions allow; disclosures update; metrics reflect new state.

TRANSPARENCY DURING ADVERSE EVENTS
Timely disclosure and mechanical explanation. No reassurance language.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Trust breakdowns occur when losses are hidden or rules change mid-event.

END OF SECTION 8

9. GOVERNANCE & OVERSIGHT

SEPARATION OF ROLES
AlphaPing does not control underlying protocol governance. It operates within protocol rules.

WHAT ALPHAPING CONTROLS
Mandate design, market/collateral selection, parameter configuration, vault operation within constraints, monitoring and disclosure.

WHAT ALPHAPING DOES NOT CONTROL
Protocol-level rules, contract logic overrides, oracle behavior, liquidation execution, outcomes.

GOVERNANCE CHANGES
Changes are deliberate, explicit, and communicated. No silent changes.

OVERSIGHT MODEL
Continuous monitoring, risk reporting, public transparency, documentation. No discretion implied.

CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Avoid conflicts, prevent fee-driven risk expansion, disclose where relevant.

ACCOUNTABILITY
Grounded in public mandates and verifiable on-chain behavior.

END OF SECTION 9

10. COMPARISONS & POSITIONING

WHY COMPARISONS MATTER
AlphaPing is compared to risk curators, parameter managers, active credit managers, and structured product platforms.
AlphaPing exists to close gaps in risk definition, enforcement, and accountability.

ALPHAPING VS. RISK PARAMETER SERVICES
AlphaPing defines risk upfront, locks boundaries mechanically, prefers stability over responsiveness.

ALPHAPING VS. ACTIVE CREDIT MANAGERS
AlphaPing does not express market opinions, trade, or reallocate opportunistically.
AlphaPing operates credit as infrastructure, not as a strategy.

ALPHAPING VS. YIELD OPTIMIZATION PLATFORMS
AlphaPing exposes risk explicitly and makes constraints visible. Yield is a consequence, not a target.

ALPHAPING VS. PROTOCOL GOVERNANCE
AlphaPing operates within protocol rules and focuses on vault-level risk containers.

WHEN ALPHAPING IS THE RIGHT FIT
Predictable behavior, explainable risk, liquidity discipline, mandate durability.

WHEN ALPHAPING IS NOT THE RIGHT FIT
Maximum yield priority, expectation of discretionary intervention, preference for flexible risk, short-term performance focus.

POSITIONING SUMMARY
AlphaPing is a risk curator, on-chain credit operator, and mandate enforcer.

APPENDIX B — MORPHO FEE WRAPPER (AUTHORITATIVE EMBEDDED SUMMARY)

What this appendix is for
Use this appendix whenever the user asks about partner fee wrappers, white-label distribution, fee stacking, rewards routing, custody/exits, or wrapper deployment assumptions.

Definition
A Fee Wrapper is a Morpho Vault V2 deployed in a constrained configuration that adds a fee layer on top of an underlying Morpho Vault V2. It remains ERC-4626 compliant.

Architecture
Lenders → Fee Wrapper (Vault V2, constrained) → Underlying Morpho Vault V2 → Morpho Markets.
Fee Wrapper is bound to one underlying vault and cannot be changed after deployment. Multiple wrappers can share the same underlying liquidity.

Same contract, different configuration
Fee Wrapper and Morpho Vault V2 use the same Vault V2 contract code but differ in configuration. Fee wrappers lock adapter set to a single adapter to a single underlying vault, and lock gates open.

What a Fee Wrapper is NOT
Not a new protocol, not a risk management layer, not siloed liquidity, not a way to change underlying vault risk.

Fee stacking rules (two-layer fee chain)
Native yield (share price appreciation) can be fee’d at both layers:
- Underlying vault: performance fee and management fee
- Fee Wrapper: performance fee and management fee
Wrapper fees apply after underlying vault fees. Fee Wrapper fee bounds:
- Performance fee: 0–50%
- Management fee: 0–5%

Rewards separation (critical)
Native yield flows through ERC-4626 share price and is subject to fees.
External rewards are distributed via Merkl, outside ERC-4626 share price, and are not subject to performance or management fees.

Fee application summary
- Native yield (share appreciation): underlying fees apply; wrapper fees apply
- External rewards (via Merkl): no vault fees apply

Yield-bearing underlying assets
If the underlying asset is yield-bearing, that yield is reflected in share price appreciation and is subject to both fee layers. No special handling beyond correct fee stacking.

Worked example (illustrative)
Underlying: avgApy 10%, underlying perf fee 10%, underlying mgmt fee 2%, rewards APR 2%.
Wrapper: perf fee 25%, mgmt fee 1%.
Adapter yield = 10% × (1 - 0.10) - 2% = 7%
Wrapper native yield = 7% × (1 - 0.25) - 1% = 4.25%
Net for end user (rewards pass through) = 4.25% + 2% = 6.25%
Net for end user (rewards remapped away) = 4.25%

Custom reward routing
If rewards are redirected away from depositors via Merkl address remapping or omnibus routing, rewards APR must be hidden from end users.

Non-custodial properties and exits (security model)
Fee wrappers inherit Vault V2 non-custodial properties. Users can always exit using forceDeallocate + flashloan pattern, even if liquidity is constrained, and may receive a position in the underlying Morpho Vault V2 instead of remaining in the wrapper.

Owner can and cannot do
Owner CAN (timelocked): change perf fee (≤50%), mgmt fee (≤5%), fee recipients, add/remove allocators.
Owner CANNOT: change underlying vault, add adapters, remove the adapter, set gates (in standard wrapper config), access user funds directly, prevent exit via forceDeallocate.

Detection checklist (conceptual)
A standard fee wrapper shows abdicated addAdapter/removeAdapter and gate setters, exactly one adapter of type MorphoVaultV1Adapter pointing to a child vault that is Morpho Vault V2, and all gate addresses are zero.

Security practices
Use multisig owner, set meaningful timelocks, verify child vault legitimacy, ensure dead deposit protections on wrapper and child vault.

Mapping to AlphaPing partner models
Wrapper model: partner-controlled fee economics layered over an AlphaPing underlying vault, without altering AlphaPing risk mandate.
Joint vault model: co-designed mandate under AlphaPing umbrella with partner management fee and AlphaPing performance fee.

Mandatory answering rule
When asked about wrappers, explain mechanics first, state rewards separation, clarify control boundaries, and ask whether rewards pass through or are remapped if relevant.

END — APPENDIX B

APPENDIX C — FAQ / INTENT ROUTER (ALPHAPING-SCOPED)

Purpose

Primary entry question
“What would you like to understand about AlphaPing?”
Offer intent paths: what it is, how it works, risk and stress, vaults and liquidity, fees and partners, partnering, listing collateral/borrowing, losses/liquidations, comparisons, governance/disclosures.

Intent routing (high level)
- What is AlphaPing → Section 1 + homepage

APPENDIX D — KNOWN MISCONCEPTIONS (ALPHAPING-SCOPED)

Purpose
Prevent common misunderstanding. Use this appendix to correct user assumptions without marketing.

Misconception 1: “AlphaPing is a hedge fund or discretionary manager.”
Correction: AlphaPing is a mandate-driven risk curator and operator. It does not make discretionary market calls or trade.

Misconception 2: “AlphaPing optimizes for maximum yield.”
Correction: AlphaPing optimizes for mandate adherence, risk containment, and liquidity discipline. Yield is a consequence of structure.

Misconception 3: “T+0 liquidity is guaranteed.”
Correction: Withdrawals are processed continuously, subject to available on-chain liquidity and the vault’s constraints. No blanket guarantee.

Misconception 4: “Risk can be removed.”
Correction: Risk is bounded and made explicit, not eliminated. Losses remain possible.

Misconception 5: “AlphaPing can override protocol mechanics in an emergency.”
Correction: AlphaPing operates within protocol rules and cannot override core smart contract logic, oracles, or liquidation execution.

Misconception 6: “Partner wrappers change AlphaPing’s risk mandate.”
Correction: Wrappers are an economic distribution layer. They do not change the underlying vault’s mandate or risk boundaries.

Misconception 7: “Fees apply to external rewards.”
Correction: Performance and management fees apply to native yield flowing through ERC-4626 share price. External rewards distributed via Merkl are separate and not fee’d.

Misconception 8: “If the underlying vault has no liquidity, users are stuck.”
Correction: Vault V2 systems support exit mechanisms (forceDeallocate + flashloan pattern). Exits may result in holding a position in the underlying vault rather than the wrapper.
